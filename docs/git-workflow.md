## Workflow

### For Contributors
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make changes and commit with conventional commits
4. Push to your fork
5. Create a PR targeting the `dev` branch

### For Maintainers
1. Work on `dev` branch for new features
2. Merge feature branches into `dev`
3. When ready for release, merge `dev` into `main`
4. Tag releases on `main`
5. Publish to npm

## Commit Message Convention

## Branch Protection Rules (Recommended)

When you push to GitHub, set up these branch protection rules:

- **main**: Require PR reviews, status checks, and up-to-date branches
- **dev**: Require status checks and up-to-date branches
- **feature/*, fix/*, docs/***: No restrictions (for contributors)

## Release Process

1. Ensure all tests pass on `dev`
2. Merge `dev` into `main`
3. Update version in `package.json`
4. Create a git tag: `git tag v1.0.2`
5. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.2`
6. Create GitHub release with changelog
7. Publish to npm: `npm publish`

## Next Steps
